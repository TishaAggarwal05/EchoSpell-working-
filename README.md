# EchoSpell
Where Speech Becomes Magic â€” A Fantasy-Themed Speech Therapy Platform for Kids

In the enchanted land of EchoSpell, every word holds power, and every sound unlocks new adventures.
EchoSpell is a gamified, fantasy-themed speech therapy web app that transforms traditional articulation practice into an immersive journey. Children don the role of young spellcasters-in-training, mastering magical phonemes to unlock new levels and sharpen their pronunciation skills â€” all while having fun. This fantasy layer isnâ€™t just decorative; it plays a vital role in keeping kids engaged, motivated, and emotionally invested in their speech development journey.

âœ¨ Features
ðŸ§  Initial Phoneme Assessment
Powered by Azure Speech API, EchoSpell listens to what the child says and analyzes the phonemes for pronunciation accuracy.

ðŸ‘¤ Personalized Phoneme Profile
Based on the initial assessment, each child receives a customized profile highlighting problematic phonemes.

ðŸŽ¯ LLM-Generated Focused Speech Exercises
Using the LLaMA 3 model, personalized speech exercises are generated dynamically to focus on the childâ€™s specific articulation challenges.

ðŸ“Š Dynamic Level Progression
Each time the child practices, their performance shapes the next level â€” keeping the journey adaptive and continuously challenging.

ðŸ“ˆ Phoneme Progress Tracking
A visual chart tracks the improvement of each phoneme over time, showing growth and motivating continued practice.

ðŸ“– Chapter-Based Visual Aids
Each chapter presents a helpful popup â€” a visual guide with a description of how to pronounce the phoneme correctly, available anytime for reference.
