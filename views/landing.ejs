    <p class="storyline-text">
        In a world where spells are sung and words hold power, a new magic academy has opened its enchanted gates â€“ EchoSpell. <br>

Long ago, the Spoken Realms were filled with harmony, where young wizards and witches cast spells with perfect pronunciation. But over time, the Echo Crystals, which carried the sound of true speech, dimmed and faded. Now, only a few gifted children can awaken them â€“ and you might be one of them! <br>

At EchoSpell, you are not just a student â€“ you are a Voice Mage in training. Each phoneme you master restores a crystal, each level unlocks new magic, and each word brings the realm back to life. Guided by magical mentors, talking spellbooks, and shimmering scrolls, youâ€™ll embark on an enchanted journey to discover the true power of your voice.
